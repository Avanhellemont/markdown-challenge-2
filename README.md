### A funny story
I had a dwarf rabbit that bullied my dog, a German Shepherd. when my dog ​​approached my rabbit, the latter would come out of its cage and chase the dog through the house. He even climbed onto the couch in pursuit of the dog. A real little tint this rabbit with the punk crest. One day,
he even almost gave my dog ​​a third nostril.
#### Anyway, my rabbit scared my dog
